				<h1>Details</h1>
				<p>PHP - Originally stood for "Personal Home Page" but now stands for
					 "Hypertext Preprocessor" (***Recursive Acronym***)</p>
				<p>PHP was developed in Canada</p>
				<p>Orignially created in 1994</p>
				<p>The "first" developer was Rasmus Lerdorf, taking syntax from C, Java, and Perl</p>

			<!--this is php's purpose-->

				<h1>Purpose</h1>
				<p>Initially, the language was created to simply monitor the creator's 
					online resume and personal information</p>
				<br>
				<p>Currently, PHP is a server-side scripting language. Its primary use is for
					 web development, but it can also be used for general purpose programming.</p>
				<br>
				<p>PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language that is most commonly used for 
					dynamic web applications. Since it can be interspersed with HTML, PHP can make 
					it easy to generate those dynamic contents on websites or elsewhere. PHP 
					differs from the client-side Javascript we will be learning in that code 
					is executed on the server-side, which then generates the HTML that is sent 
					to the client. The client only sees what the script has run, and not the 
					underlying code itself.</p>
